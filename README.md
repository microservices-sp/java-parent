### Documentation API

Simple API to help documenting REST endpoints with Swagger. Contains abstractions that aim to ease the process of creating good quality and durable documents for REST services.

For more information about Swagger, check [here](https://swagger.io).

### Samples

In this structure we have all samples presented or created by community during our Meetups, in order to demonstrate the concepts, libraries usage or other important topics for real-life projects.
